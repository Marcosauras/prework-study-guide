# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

## Description
This is a study guide created by boot camp students for anyone that would want to know what we are learning. It contains a few sample notes of what we learned in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript during our pre-work.

## Usage

This study guide is a bit straight forward, and organized into four groups (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) which makes it easier to use for anyone who just wants easy information. If you don't know what you should study first, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open up on your webpage in the browser. There you will see all of the topics we have learned from prework, along with a suggestion on which one to start with to start learning to code.
